  #  What is needed before I start?
You will need a few programs if you want to use this turtorial correctly.
  
  1. [Nodejs](http://link.url/) - Nodejs is a powerful tool that basicly takes your javascript code and converts it into a runable aplication on your computer.
  2. [npm](http://link.url/) - npm is a packaging software that will (in this case) download the nodes you need to connect to the discord API. (This comes with Nodejs)
 3. Some sort of text editor, just don't use notepad! use a program made to code in like [Atom](http://link.url/) or [Sublime](http://link.url/)
